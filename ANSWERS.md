- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
    - The only time you would use a class component these days are when you're working on old code that already uses them and your boss wants you to keep it consistent.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
    - componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, constructor: running extra code when the component is first created, whenever it updates, and creating initial state, respectively.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
    - A custom hook lets you reuse code between components or projects in a more convenient way than copying and pasting.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
    - Coded testing is important because manually testing multiple parts of an app every time you make a small change will take too much time for larger projects.
